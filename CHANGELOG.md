# Changelog

## 0.4.0

Someone decided that axum-sessions was bad so I had to rewrite a heap of stuff. I cried. It wasn't
fun.

## 0.3.x

The web interface worked and it mostly responded to really arbitrary DNS queries, but a lot of
things were bad.

## 0.2.x

The slightly lighter times. Packets were still around. Kids were humbled by our progress.

## 0.1.x

The dark times. Packets were flung. Kids were terrified.
